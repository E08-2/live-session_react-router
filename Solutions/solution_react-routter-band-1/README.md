# React Routing: Band Landing Page

Please create a small React app for your favorite music band.  
Your navigation should contain as many items as the members of your band (4+ members. You may like The White Stripes, but we need more routes!)

Use the **React Router** package to handle your navigation.

If you have some extra time:

1. You can add some extra styling to your pages to make them look even nicer! 

2. If you have enough time, you are also welcome to research, and experiment with, **transitions** between views - how we can add some extra effects to our transitions from one view to another. Here is an interesting library:
